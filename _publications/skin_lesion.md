excerpt: 'Skin Cancer is the most common (accounting for 40%
of cancer cases globally) and potentially life-threatening type of
cancers. It was diagnosed in about 5.6 million individuals last year.
Automated classification of skin lesions through images has been
a challenge throughout the years because of fine variability in their
appearance. Deep Learning techniques exhibit potential in
tackling fine-margined image-based analysis and manage to
provide accurate results. The three modelling stages include data
collection and augmentation, model architecture and finally
prediction into 7 different types of skin cancer namely actinic
keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis-like lesions,
dermatofibroma, melanoma, melanocytic nevi and vascular
lesions. A Convolutional Neural Network was fabricated (using
TensorFlow) obtaining an accuracy of 81.24%. Further Transfer
learning Approach was implemented in PyTorch, which yielded
accuracies of 96.40%, 98.20%, 98.70% and 99.04% respectively
for Wide Resnet101, Resnet50, Densenet121 and VGG19 with
batch normalization, which are all trained end-to-end from images
directly, to proliferate the scalability of these models and curtail
initial diagnostic costs. The aim of this research paper is to render
non-invasive skin cancer screening a common norm, making it
simpler.'

Abstract: Skin Cancer is the most common (accounting for 40%
of cancer cases globally) and potentially life-threatening type of
cancers. It was diagnosed in about 5.6 million individuals last year.
Automated classification of skin lesions through images has been
a challenge throughout the years because of fine variability in their
appearance. Deep Learning techniques exhibit potential in
tackling fine-margined image-based analysis and manage to
provide accurate results. The three modelling stages include data
collection and augmentation, model architecture and finally
prediction into 7 different types of skin cancer namely actinic
keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis-like lesions,
dermatofibroma, melanoma, melanocytic nevi and vascular
lesions. A Convolutional Neural Network was fabricated (using
TensorFlow) obtaining an accuracy of 81.24%. Further Transfer
learning Approach was implemented in PyTorch, which yielded
accuracies of 96.40%, 98.20%, 98.70% and 99.04% respectively
for Wide Resnet101, Resnet50, Densenet121 and VGG19 with
batch normalization, which are all trained end-to-end from images
directly, to proliferate the scalability of these models and curtail
initial diagnostic costs. The aim of this research paper is to render
non-invasive skin cancer screening a common norm, making it
simpler.
