title: "Hyper Localization of Leaks in Piping and Cabling Systems using Reinforcement Learning"

excerpt: 'Leaks have undoubtedly been one of the biggest
problems plaguing piping and cabling systems across industries
like electricity and power, building and smart cities, oil and gas,
etc. Addressing these leaks in time becomes paramount as failure
leads to a complete standstill of the transportation chain. Most AI
based leak detection systems have failed to reach the deployment
state as these systems are prone to output false positives. It is
imperative to observe that these leaks don’t occur every day or in
other words they are rare events. But when they do occur, these
leaks more often than not go unnoticed. Due to the insufficient
number of identified leak points, it becomes difficult to build an AI
based model for the same. In an attempt to aid/replace rule-based
and physics-based leak detection systems, this paper proposes a
novel AI based leak detection solution using reinforcement
learning which not only reduces false positives but also extends
itself to multi armed bandit-based leak localization. By using this
methodology, we model the latent behavior of any piping or
cabling systems and provide a Q-learning based shortest path
recommendation in order to help the maintenance team reach the
leak node in a short amount of time.'

Abstract: Leaks have undoubtedly been one of the biggest
problems plaguing piping and cabling systems across industries
like electricity and power, building and smart cities, oil and gas,
etc. Addressing these leaks in time becomes paramount as failure
leads to a complete standstill of the transportation chain. Most AI
based leak detection systems have failed to reach the deployment
state as these systems are prone to output false positives. It is
imperative to observe that these leaks don’t occur every day or in
other words they are rare events. But when they do occur, these
leaks more often than not go unnoticed. Due to the insufficient
number of identified leak points, it becomes difficult to build an AI
based model for the same. In an attempt to aid/replace rule-based
and physics-based leak detection systems, this paper proposes a
novel AI based leak detection solution using reinforcement
learning which not only reduces false positives but also extends
itself to multi armed bandit-based leak localization. By using this
methodology, we model the latent behavior of any piping or
cabling systems and provide a Q-learning based shortest path
recommendation in order to help the maintenance team reach the
leak node in a short amount of time.
