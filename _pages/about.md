I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu). With a strong background in software development and a passion for building reliable, scalable systems. As a Software Engineer at UBS, I designed automation frameworks, improved system performance, and created tools used by teams across seven countries. These experiences taught me how to write clean, efficient code and build solutions that solve real business problems.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects, including an AI-based tool for detecting eye diseases, a language converter that transforms C code into Java and Python, and dashboards that simplify complex financial data. I enjoy breaking down problems, writing code that works well in production, and learning new technologies as I go. I’m confident working with languages like Python, Java, and C++, and I have hands-on experience with tools like AWS, Azure, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

Outside of tech, I’m a national speedball player, which has taught me teamwork, focus, and discipline.
