I‚Äôm a Backend & Cloud Engineer with a focus on building scalable, reliable systems that solve real-world problems. I‚Äôve built end-to-end automation frameworks for order management systems used in global investment banking workflows, trained AI models to help doctors detect eye diseases faster, and developed backend tools that support high-performance, real-time applications.

My strengths lie in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure ‚Äî especially with AWS, C++, Python, Java, and tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and TensorFlow. I enjoy working on projects that blend clean architecture, AI, and system performance.
Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #3BA3A5; font-weight: 500;">Indiana University Bloomington</a>, diving deeper into cloud-native engineering, AI integration, and large-scale systems.

What sets me apart? I‚Äôm hands-on, detail-driven, and always thinking about how to make systems better ‚Äî more efficient, more scalable, and easier to maintain. I care about writing clean code, building things that last, and pushing ideas into production.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a national-level speedball player, and I bring the same focus and discipline from sports into every line of code I write.

I‚Äôve worked on a variety of projects, including an AI-based tool for detecting eye diseases, a language converter that transforms C code into Java and Python, and dashboards that simplify complex financial data. I enjoy breaking down problems, writing clean code, and learning new technologies as I go.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a national speedball player, which has taught me teamwork, focus, and discipline.
