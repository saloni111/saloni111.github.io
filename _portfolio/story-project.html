<ul>
  <li>Utilized DAMO Vilab's Text2Video diffusion model and Meta AI's Text2Audio model (AudioCraft) synergistically with BERT-based sentence embedding and K-means clustering for topic segmentation to transform user-inputted story prompts into visual stories, yielding an average survey rating of 3.69/5 from user feedback.</li>
  <li>Leveraged Ollama to generate music context aware prompts (fed into AudioCraft) by configuring Mistral 7B with a system prompt.</li>
